#### Enhancement Description
Complete migration of the dynamic-text application from Svelte 5 to Next.js 15.5.2 while maintaining all Firebase backend functionality. The migration includes implementing Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture with Atomic Design principles for component organization, adding Storybook for component documentation, and achieving comprehensive test coverage.

#### Impact Assessment
- ✅ Major Impact (architectural changes required)
- Complete frontend framework replacement
- New architectural patterns (FSD)
- Enhanced developer experience with Storybook

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Migrate from Svelte 5 to Next.js 15.5.2 with zero data loss
- Maintain feature parity with existing Svelte application
- Improve component documentation through Storybook integration
- Establish robust testing infrastructure with >90% coverage
- Enable visual regression testing through Chromatic
- Implement proper state management with Redux Toolkit
- Achieve better performance and SEO through Next.js SSR/SSG

#### Background Context
The original Svelte 5 application encountered compatibility issues with Storybook, limiting the team's ability to document and test components effectively. Next.js was chosen as the migration target due to its excellent React ecosystem support, strong TypeScript integration, and compatibility with modern development tools. The Firebase backend remains unchanged to minimize risk and maintain data integrity during the migration. This migration represents an opportunity to modernize the codebase while implementing industry best practices for architecture (FSD), component design (Atomic Design), and testing (TDD with Vitest/Playwright).

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI
All components extend Material UI v7.3.2 base components with CVA (class-variance-authority) for variant management. Components follow the Atomic Design hierarchy (atoms → molecules → organisms) within the FSD architecture. Consistent theming is achieved through MUI's theme provider with TypeScript interfaces ensuring type safety across all components.

### Modified/New Screens and Views
**New Components Added (Phase 1-3):**
- **Atoms**: Input, Select, Checkbox, Radio, Typography, Alert, Badge, Chip, Progress, Skeleton
- **Molecules**: FormField, SearchBar, DatePicker, FileUpload, Pagination  
- **Organisms**: List (recently consolidated), Form, StepperForm, Navigation, Footer

All components are showcased in Storybook at http://localhost:6006 and available for import from `@/shared/ui/` paths with comprehensive test coverage.

### UI Consistency Requirements
1. **Design Token Compliance**: All components must use MUI theme tokens for colors, spacing, typography
2. **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
3. **Responsive Design**: Components must work across breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)
4. **Dark Mode Support**: Theme switching capability has been implemented for all components
5. **Visual Regression Testing**: Chromatic integration ensures visual consistency across changes

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack
**Languages**: TypeScript 5.7+, JavaScript (ES2022+)

**Integration Risks**: Existing Firebase Security Rules compatibility, Cloud Functions may need updates for Next.js SSR, User sessions during migration rollout
**Deployment Risks**: SEO impact from URL structure changes, Performance differences between Svelte and React, Bundle size increase from framework change
**Mitigation Strategies**: Maintain Firebase backend unchanged initially, Incremental migration with feature flags, Comprehensive testing of Firebase integrations, Side-by-side comparison with original Svelte app

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach
**Epic Structure Decision**: Multiple epics following the existing story structure already established in the project

The project has been organized into 6 logical epics that build upon each other:
1. Infrastructure Setup (Foundation) - Largely complete
2. Core UI Components (Building blocks) - In progress
3. Backend Integration (Data layer) - Next priority
4. TPN Features (Business logic) - Planned
5. Testing & Quality (Validation) - Planned
6. Performance & Deployment (Production) - Planned

This structure ensures coordinated migration efforts while maintaining clear boundaries between different aspects of the system.
