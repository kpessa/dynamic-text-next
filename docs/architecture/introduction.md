# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Dynamic Text Next**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project
This is a **brownfield migration project** from Svelte 5 to Next.js 15. The project structure and technology choices have been established through the migration process:
- Next.js 15.5.2 with App Router and Turbopack
- Material UI v7 for the design system
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- FSD + Atomic Design architecture pattern
- Existing code structure migrated from Svelte
