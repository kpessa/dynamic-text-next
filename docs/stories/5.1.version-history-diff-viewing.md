## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 4.2 (Dynamic Text Editor):
- Sections are the primary content units
- Each section has content and test cases

From Story 4.4 (TPN Document Generation):
- Documents have version metadata
- Export includes version information

From Story 4.5 (Ingredient Management):
- Ingredients also need version tracking
- Reference ranges change over time

### Architecture References

#### Tech Stack [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- TypeScript 5.7+ with strict mode
- Firebase Firestore for version storage
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- DOMPurify for rendering diffs

#### Project Structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Version history feature: `/src/features/version-history/`
- Version entity: `/src/entities/version/`
- Follow FSD layer dependencies

### Parent Project Version Structure
From `../dynamic-text/src/lib/VersionHistory.svelte`:
```typescript
interface Version {
  id: string;
  documentId: string;
  version: number;
  content: {
    sections: Section[];
    ingredients?: Ingredient[];
    config?: any;
  };
  metadata: {
    createdAt: Date;
    createdBy: string;
    commitMessage?: string;
    changesSummary: string;
    size: number;
  };
  diff?: {
    added: number;
    removed: number;
    modified: number;
  };
}
```

### Diff Algorithm Implementation
```typescript
class DiffEngine {
  computeDiff(oldContent: string, newContent: string): DiffResult {
    // Use Myers diff algorithm or similar
    const diffs = this.myersDiff(oldContent, newContent);
    
    return {
      hunks: this.createHunks(diffs),
      stats: this.calculateStats(diffs),
      patches: this.generatePatches(diffs)
    };
  }
  
  renderSideBySide(diff: DiffResult): HTMLElement {
    const container = document.createElement('div');
    container.className = 'diff-side-by-side';
    
    diff.hunks.forEach(hunk => {
      const row = this.createDiffRow(hunk);
      container.appendChild(row);
    });
    
    return container;
  }
  
  renderInline(diff: DiffResult): HTMLElement {
    const container = document.createElement('div');
    container.className = 'diff-inline';
    
    diff.hunks.forEach(hunk => {
      hunk.changes.forEach(change => {
        const element = this.createChangeElement(change);
        container.appendChild(element);
      });
    });
    
    return container;
  }
}
```

### Efficient Storage Pattern
```typescript
class VersionStorage {
  async saveVersion(version: Version): Promise<void> {
    // Don't store full content for every version
    const previousVersion = await this.getPreviousVersion(version.documentId);
    
    if (previousVersion) {
      // Store only the diff
      const diff = this.computeDiff(previousVersion.content, version.content);
      
      await setDoc(doc(db, 'versions', version.id), {
        ...version,
        content: undefined, // Don't store full content
        diff: diff,
        baseVersionId: previousVersion.id
      });
    } else {
      // First version - store full content
      await setDoc(doc(db, 'versions', version.id), version);
    }
  }
  
  async reconstructVersion(versionId: string): Promise<Version> {
    const version = await getDoc(doc(db, 'versions', versionId));
    
    if (version.content) {
      return version; // Full content available
    }
    
    // Reconstruct from diffs
    const baseVersion = await this.reconstructVersion(version.baseVersionId);
    const content = this.applyDiff(baseVersion.content, version.diff);
    
    return { ...version, content };
  }
}
```

### Commit Message Dialog
```typescript
interface CommitDialogProps {
  onCommit: (message: string) => void;
  changes: ChangesSummary;
  suggestions?: string[];
}

const CommitMessageDialog: React.FC<CommitDialogProps> = ({ 
  onCommit, 
  changes, 
  suggestions 
}) => {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  
  const generateSummary = () => {
    const parts = [];
    if (changes.sectionsAdded) parts.push(`Added ${changes.sectionsAdded} sections`);
    if (changes.sectionsModified) parts.push(`Modified ${changes.sectionsModified} sections`);
    if (changes.sectionsRemoved) parts.push(`Removed ${changes.sectionsRemoved} sections`);
    return parts.join(', ');
  };
  
  return (
    <Dialog open={true}>
      <DialogTitle>Save Changes</DialogTitle>
      <DialogContent>
        <Typography variant="body2">
          Changes: {generateSummary()}
        </Typography>
        <TextField
          label="Commit Message"
          value={message}
          onChange={(e) => setMessage(e.target.value)}
          multiline
          rows={3}
          fullWidth
          placeholder="Describe your changes..."
        />
        {suggestions && (
          <Box mt={2}>
            <Typography variant="caption">Suggestions:</Typography>
            {suggestions.map(s => (
              <Chip 
                key={s} 
                label={s} 
                onClick={() => setMessage(s)}
                size="small"
              />
            ))}
          </Box>
        )}
      </DialogContent>
      <DialogActions>
        <Button onClick={() => onCommit(message)}>
          Save Version
        </Button>
      </DialogActions>
    </Dialog>
  );
};
```

### Conflict Resolution UI
```typescript
interface ConflictSection {
  local: string;
  remote: string;
  base: string;
  resolved?: string;
}

const ConflictResolver: React.FC<{ conflicts: ConflictSection[] }> = ({ conflicts }) => {
  const [resolutions, setResolutions] = useState<Record<number, string>>({});
  
  const resolveConflict = (index: number, resolution: 'local' | 'remote' | 'manual', custom?: string) => {
    let resolved: string;
    
    switch (resolution) {
      case 'local':
        resolved = conflicts[index].local;
        break;
      case 'remote':
        resolved = conflicts[index].remote;
        break;
      case 'manual':
        resolved = custom || '';
        break;
    }
    
    setResolutions({ ...resolutions, [index]: resolved });
  };
  
  return (
    <div>
      {conflicts.map((conflict, index) => (
        <Card key={index}>
          <CardContent>
            <Grid container spacing={2}>
              <Grid item xs={6}>
                <Typography variant="subtitle2">Your Version</Typography>
                <pre>{conflict.local}</pre>
                <Button onClick={() => resolveConflict(index, 'local')}>
                  Use This
                </Button>
              </Grid>
              <Grid item xs={6}>
                <Typography variant="subtitle2">Their Version</Typography>
                <pre>{conflict.remote}</pre>
                <Button onClick={() => resolveConflict(index, 'remote')}>
                  Use This
                </Button>
              </Grid>
            </Grid>
          </CardContent>
        </Card>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Version Timeline Visualization
```typescript
const VersionTimeline: React.FC<{ versions: Version[] }> = ({ versions }) => {
  return (
    <Timeline>
      {versions.map((version, index) => (
        <TimelineItem key={version.id}>
          <TimelineSeparator>
            <TimelineDot color={index === 0 ? 'primary' : 'grey'} />
            {index < versions.length - 1 && <TimelineConnector />}
          </TimelineSeparator>
          <TimelineContent>
            <Paper elevation={3} sx={{ p: 2 }}>
              <Typography variant="h6">
                v{version.version}
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="body2" color="text.secondary">
                {version.metadata.commitMessage || 'No message'}
              </Typography>
              <Typography variant="caption">
                {version.metadata.createdBy} • {formatDate(version.metadata.createdAt)}
              </Typography>
              <Box mt={1}>
                <Chip label={`+${version.diff?.added || 0}`} color="success" size="small" />
                <Chip label={`-${version.diff?.removed || 0}`} color="error" size="small" />
                <Chip label={`~${version.diff?.modified || 0}`} color="warning" size="small" />
              </Box>
            </Paper>
          </TimelineContent>
        </TimelineItem>
      ))}
    </Timeline>
  );
};
```
