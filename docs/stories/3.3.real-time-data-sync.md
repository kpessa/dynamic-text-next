# Story 3.3: Real-time Data Sync

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** changes to data to appear immediately across all my devices,

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1 and 3.2:
- Firebase is configured (anonymous access only if needed)
- Firestore SDK is initialized without offline persistence
- Redux slices exist for main collections (simulations, references, ingredients)
- Base Firestore services are implemented at entity level

### Real-time Architecture
From [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]:
```typescript
// Redux state structure for real-time updates
interface SectionState {
  sections: Section[];
  activeSectionId: number | null;
  testResults: TestSummary | null;
  isDirty: boolean;  // Track unsaved changes
}
```

### Performance Requirements
From [Source: architecture/performance-optimization.md#performance-targets]:
- Initial Load: <3s on 3G
- Time to Interactive: <5s
- FID (First Input Delay): <100ms
- Real-time update latency: <100ms (custom requirement)

### Firestore Real-time Patterns
Implement these patterns for optimal real-time sync:
```typescript
// Listener with cleanup
const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(
  query(collection(db, 'simulations'), where('creatorId', '==', userId)),
  (snapshot) => {
    snapshot.docChanges().forEach((change) => {
      if (change.type === 'added') { /* handle */ }
      if (change.type === 'modified') { /* handle */ }
      if (change.type === 'removed') { /* handle */ }
    });
  },
  (error) => {
    // Handle errors and reconnection
  }
);
```

### Optimistic Update Pattern
```typescript
// 1. Apply update immediately to UI
dispatch(optimisticUpdate(data));
// 2. Send to Firestore
try {
  await updateDoc(docRef, data);
  dispatch(confirmUpdate(data));
} catch (error) {
  dispatch(rollbackUpdate(data));
}
```

### Simple Connection Monitoring (Optional)
Note: Connection state UI removed per requirements. This is for debugging only:
```typescript
// Optional: Log connection state for debugging
const connectedRef = ref(database, '.info/connected');
onValue(connectedRef, (snap) => {
  console.log('Firebase connection:', snap.val() ? 'connected' : 'disconnected');
});
```

### Batch Operation Limits
From Firestore documentation:
- Maximum 500 operations per batch
- Maximum 1MB per batch write
- Use transactions for atomic operations

### Testing Requirements

#### Testing Standards
From [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Real-time sync tests should use Firestore emulator
- Test connection interruptions and recovery
- Verify no memory leaks from listeners
- Test multi-client scenarios

#### Performance Testing
- Measure update propagation latency
- Test with various network conditions
- Verify batch operation optimization
- Monitor memory usage with multiple listeners
