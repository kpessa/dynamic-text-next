# Story 4.2: Dynamic Text Editor with Ingredient Sidebar

## Status
✅ Completed

## Story
**As a** healthcare provider,
**I want** a dynamic text editor with an ingredient sidebar on the home page,
**so that** I can create and edit dynamic medical documents with easy access to grouped ingredients

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Home page displays a dynamic text editor as the main content area
2. Left sidebar shows ingredients grouped by type (Macronutrient, Micronutrient, Additive, Salt, Diluent, Other)
3. Editor supports both static text and dynamic JavaScript sections
4. Live preview panel appears on the right side showing rendered output
5. Users can add, edit, delete, and reorder sections
6. Ingredients can be dragged or clicked to insert into editor
7. Dynamic sections execute safely in sandboxed environment
8. Editor state persists during session using Redux
9. Mobile-responsive layout with collapsible sidebar and preview

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story implementation for this epic.

### Data Models
**Section Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#section-and-test-types]:
```typescript
interface Section {
  id: number;
  type: 'static' | 'dynamic';
  name: string;
  content: string;
  testCases: TestCase[];
}
```

**LoadedIngredient Model** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#workspace-types]:
```typescript
interface LoadedIngredient {
  id?: string;
  name: string;
  keyname?: string;
  type?: 'Macronutrient' | 'Micronutrient' | 'Additive' | 'Salt' | 'Diluent' | 'Other';
  referenceRanges?: ReferenceRange[];
}
```

### Component Specifications
**Dynamic Text Processor** [Source: architecture/components.md#dynamic-text-processor]:
- Process templates with sandboxed JavaScript execution
- Methods: `processTemplate()`, `evaluateLogic()`, `validateVariables()`, `executeInSandbox()`
- Uses Web Workers and Babel for transpilation

**Secure Code Executor** [Source: architecture/components.md#secure-code-executor]:
- Execute user code in isolation with 5s timeout
- Uses Web Workers, Babel standalone, DOMPurify for sanitization
- Must inject TPN context safely

### File Locations
Based on FSD architecture [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]:
- Home page: `/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`
- Widgets: `/src/widgets/ingredient-sidebar/`, `/src/widgets/editor-panel/`, `/src/widgets/preview-panel/`
- Editor feature: `/src/features/editor/`
- Shared UI components: `/src/shared/ui/atoms/`, `/src/shared/ui/molecules/`
- Redux store: `/src/features/editor/model/editorSlice.ts`

### State Management Architecture
**Redux Store Structure** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#redux-store-structure]:
```typescript
interface EditorState {
  sections: Section[];
  activeSectionId: number | null;
  testResults: TestSummary | null;
  isDirty: boolean;
  ingredients: LoadedIngredient[];
  previewContent: string;
}
```

### Technical Constraints
- Maximum 500 lines per component [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- All async operations wrapped in try-catch [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- Components >100 lines must use React.memo [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- Use absolute imports with @ alias [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### Security Requirements
**Code Execution Security** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#secure-sandbox-implementation]:
- Sanitize all code with DOMPurify before execution
- Transpile with Babel for safety
- Execute in Web Worker with 5s timeout
- Create safe context with limited API access

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Test files co-located with source: `*.test.tsx`
- Use Vitest for unit tests
- Use @testing-library/react for component tests
- Minimum 80% coverage for business logic
- E2E tests with Playwright for critical workflows

### Test Requirements for This Story
1. Unit tests for Redux editor slice
2. Component tests for all widgets
3. Integration tests for secure code execution
4. E2E test for complete editor workflow
5. Test ingredient drag-and-drop functionality
6. Test responsive layout on different screen sizes
