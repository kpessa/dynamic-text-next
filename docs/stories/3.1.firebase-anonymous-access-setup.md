# Story 3.1: Firebase Anonymous Access Setup (Optional)

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to configure Firebase for anonymous access if required,
**so that** the application can interact with Firestore without user authentication.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Firebase SDK is configured for the Next.js application
2. Test direct Firestore access without authentication
3. If required by Security Rules, implement anonymous sign-in only
4. Minimal Redux state for Firebase connection status
5. No user profiles or session management
6. Application functions without any login UI

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Initialize Firebase SDK** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Install Firebase SDK packages if not already installed
  - [x] Create Firebase configuration file at `src/shared/config/firebase.ts`
  - [x] Initialize Firebase app with project credentials
  - [x] Export initialized Firebase app and Firestore instances

- [x] **Task 2: Test Firestore Direct Access** (AC: 2)
  - [x] Attempt to read from Firestore without authentication
  - [x] Attempt to write to Firestore without authentication
  - [x] Document which operations require authentication
  - [x] Determine if anonymous auth is needed at all

- [x] **Task 3: Implement Anonymous Auth (Only if Required)** (AC: 3)
  - [x] If Firestore Security Rules require auth, implement anonymous sign-in
  - [x] Create minimal auth service at `src/shared/lib/firebase/anonymousAuth.ts`
  - [x] Auto-sign-in anonymously on app initialization
  - [x] No user-facing auth UI or controls

- [x] **Task 4: Create Minimal Connection State** (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create simple Firebase connection slice at `src/features/firebase/model/firebaseSlice.ts`
  - [x] Track only: isConnected, isInitialized
  - [x] No user data, no auth state, no session info
  - [x] Use for debugging/monitoring only

- [x] **Task 5: Write Tests** (AC: All)
  - [x] Test Firebase initialization
  - [x] Test Firestore connectivity
  - [x] If anonymous auth used, test auto-sign-in
  - [x] Verify no auth UI is exposed

## Dev Notes

### Simplified Requirements
Per user clarification:
- No authentication layer needed
- Anonymous auth only if Firestore Security Rules require it
- No user management, profiles, or session persistence
- Focus on direct Firebase data access

### Firebase Configuration
From [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Firebase/Firestore: Latest version
- Configure at `src/shared/config/firebase.ts`

### Anonymous Auth Pattern (If Needed)
```typescript
// Only implement if Firestore access fails without auth
import { getAuth, signInAnonymously } from 'firebase/auth';

export async function initializeAnonymousAccess() {
  const auth = getAuth();
  try {
    await signInAnonymously(auth);
    console.log('Anonymous access initialized');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Anonymous auth failed:', error);
  }
}
```

### Minimal Redux State
```typescript
interface FirebaseState {
  isInitialized: boolean;
  isConnected: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

### Testing Approach
1. First test if Firestore works without any authentication
2. Only implement anonymous auth if absolutely required
3. Keep implementation minimal - no UI, no user management

### File Locations
From [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Firebase config: `src/shared/config/firebase.ts`
- Firebase utilities: `src/shared/lib/firebase/`
- Connection state: `src/features/firebase/model/`
