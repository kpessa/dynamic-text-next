# Story 5.3: Ingredient Diff Viewer & Version Comparison

## Status
Mostly Complete - Core Functionality and UI Implemented

## Story
**As a** medical content manager,

**so that** I can identify differences, track changes, and make informed decisions about content updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Side-by-side and unified diff view modes
2. Compare ingredient configurations across different population types (NEO, CHILD, ADOLESCENT, ADULT)
3. Compare versions within same population type
4. Highlight differences with color coding and visual indicators
5. Show/hide identical content toggle
6. Render both HTML preview and raw code view
7. Support word-level and character-level diff granularity
8. Export diff results in multiple formats (HTML, PDF, JSON)
9. Link shared ingredients across populations
10. Performance optimization for large content comparisons

  ingredientId: string;
  healthSystem: string;
  mode: 'populations' | 'versions';
  selections: {
    populations?: Set<PopulationType>;

#### Component Standards [Source: architecture/components.md]
- Use Material UI Dialog for modal wrapper
- Implement responsive grid layouts
- Follow WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Use React.memo for performance optimization
- Implement error boundaries for robustness

#### External Dependencies [Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
```typescript
// Required libraries (add to package.json)
dependencies: {
  'diff': '^5.1.0',           // Core diff algorithm
  'diff2html': '^3.4.0',      // Enhanced diff visualization
  'dompurify': '^3.0.0',      // HTML sanitization
  '@babel/standalone': '^7.0.0', // Dynamic code transformation
  'jspdf': '^2.5.0',          // PDF generation
  'html2canvas': '^1.4.0',    // HTML to image conversion
}
```

### Population Type Configuration
```typescript
// From parent project
const POPULATION_TYPES = {
  NEO: 'neonatal',
  CHILD: 'child',
  ADOLESCENT: 'adolescent',
  ADULT: 'adult'
} as const;

const populationInfo = {
  neonatal: {
    name: 'Neonatal',
    color: '#ff6b6b',
    bgColor: '#ffe0e0'
  },
  child: {
    name: 'Child',
    color: '#4ecdc4',
    bgColor: '#e0f7f5'
  },
  adolescent: {
    name: 'Adolescent',
    color: '#45b7d1',
    bgColor: '#e0f2f7'
  },
  adult: {
    name: 'Adult',
    color: '#5f27cd',
    bgColor: '#ede7f6'
  }
};
```

### Diff Algorithm Implementation
```typescript
// Core diff engine pattern
class DiffEngine {
  constructor(private options: DiffOptions) {}
  
  compare(left: string, right: string): DiffResult[] {
    if (this.options.granularity === 'word') {
      return this.wordDiff(left, right);
    } else {
      return this.charDiff(left, right);
    }
  }
  
  private wordDiff(left: string, right: string): DiffResult[] {
    const leftTokens = this.tokenize(left);
    const rightTokens = this.tokenize(right);
    return this.myersAlgorithm(leftTokens, rightTokens);
  }
  
  private tokenize(text: string): string[] {
    // Split on word boundaries while preserving whitespace
    return text.match(/\S+|\s+/g) || [];
  }
}
```

### Performance Considerations [Source: architecture/performance-optimization.md]
- Virtual scrolling for diffs > 1000 lines
- Web Worker for diff calculations > 100KB
- Cache diff results for 30 minutes
- Lazy load syntax highlighting
- Debounce view updates by 150ms
- Maximum comparison size: 5MB per document

### Testing Requirements

#### Testing Standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test Location**: `__tests__` folders adjacent to source
- **Framework**: Vitest 3.2.4
- **Coverage Target**: 80% for critical paths
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock Firebase calls, use real diff algorithms

Key Test Scenarios:
1. Compare identical content (should show no differences)
2. Compare completely different content
3. Handle large files (>1MB)
4. Test all population type combinations
5. Verify HTML sanitization prevents XSS
6. Test export functionality for all formats
7. Verify synchronized scrolling in side-by-side view
8. Test performance with 10,000+ line diffs

### Security Considerations [Source: architecture/security-architecture.md]
- Sanitize all HTML content with DOMPurify
- Validate export file names to prevent path traversal
- Limit comparison size to prevent DoS
- Use Content Security Policy for rendered HTML
- Escape special characters in diff output

### Accessibility Requirements
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys for lines, tab for controls)
- Screen reader announcements for diff changes
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management in modal
- ARIA labels for all controls
- Color-blind friendly diff colors
