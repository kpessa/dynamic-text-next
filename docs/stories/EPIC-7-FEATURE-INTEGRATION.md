# Epic 7: Feature Integration & Workflows

## Epic Overview

**Epic ID**: EPIC-7  
**Epic Name**: Feature Integration & Workflows  
**Epic Goal**: Connect isolated features into cohesive user workflows with Firebase persistence  
**Priority**: P0 - Critical Path  
**Estimated Duration**: 6-8 weeks  
**Dependencies**: Epic 3 (Backend Integration) partial completion required  

## Business Value

This epic transforms the application from a collection of isolated components into a functional medical calculation and documentation system. It directly enables the core value proposition: clinicians can create, manage, and compare TPN formulas across different patient populations with real-time synchronization.

## Success Criteria

1. **End-to-end TPN workflow**: User can calculate, save, and retrieve TPN formulas
2. **Cross-feature data flow**: Calculations flow seamlessly to ingredients to comparisons
3. **Multi-device sync**: Changes appear in real-time across all connected sessions
4. **Data persistence**: All user data persists in Firebase with proper structure
5. **Performance targets**: 
   - Save operations < 500ms
   - Load operations < 1s
   - Real-time sync < 100ms

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow Architecture
```
User Input → TPN Calculator → Redux Store → Firebase
                    ↓
            Shared Ingredients ← → DiffViewer
                    ↓
            Version History → Audit Trail
```

### Firebase Schema
```typescript
/users/{userId}/
  /preferences/
  /sessions/
  
/ingredients/{ingredientId}/
  - name: string
  - displayName: string
  - population: PopulationType
  - values: TPNValues
  - formula: string[]
  - metadata: {...}
  
/sharedIngredients/{hash}/
  - referenceCount: number
  - populations: PopulationType[]
  - linkedIngredients: Map
  
/tpnCalculations/{calcId}/
  - userId: string
  - timestamp: Timestamp
  - inputs: PatientData
  - results: TPNValues
  - advisorType: string
```

## Dependencies

- Epic 3 Stories 3.1 & 3.2 must be complete (Firebase setup)
- UI components from Epic 2 must be production-ready
- Firebase project must have security rules configured
- Testing environment must include Firebase emulators

## Metrics & KPIs

3. **Design Reviews**: UI changes should go through design review before implementation
4. **Documentation**: Update user documentation as features are completed
5. **Demo Preparation**: Each sprint should produce a demoable integration
6. **Epic Dependencies**: This epic depends on Epic 3 (Backend) and Epic 4 (TPN Features) being substantially complete
