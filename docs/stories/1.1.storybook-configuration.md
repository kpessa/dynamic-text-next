# STORY-003: Storybook Configuration

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
**Completed Date**: 2025-01-02
**Developer**: Claude Code

## Story Description
As a developer, I need Storybook 8.x configured with React and TypeScript support so that I can develop and test components in isolation with a proper component library.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Storybook 8.x installed and configured
- [x] React/Vite integration working
- [x] TypeScript support enabled
- [x] Path aliases configured
- [x] Redux Provider integrated
- [x] Sample component with stories created
- [x] No runtime errors in Storybook

## Implementation Details

### 1. Package Installation
```bash
pnpm add -D @storybook/react-vite @storybook/react @storybook/addon-essentials @storybook/addon-interactions @storybook/test storybook @vitejs/plugin-react
```

### 2. Configuration Files Created
- `.storybook/main.ts` - Main Storybook configuration with path aliases
- `.storybook/preview.tsx` - Preview configuration with Redux and theme providers

### 3. Components Created
- `src/shared/ui/atoms/Button/Button.tsx` - Base button component using CVA
- `src/shared/ui/atoms/Button/Button.stories.tsx` - Comprehensive button stories

### 4. Key Features Implemented
- **CVA Integration**: Used class-variance-authority for variant management
- **Redux Integration**: Store provider wrapped around all stories
- **Theme Support**: Dark/light mode toggle in Storybook toolbar
- **Path Aliases**: All FSD paths properly resolved
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety in stories

### 5. Issues Resolved
- **Runtime Error**: Fixed incorrect imports in example stories (`storybook/test` → `@storybook/test`)
- **React Import**: Added missing React imports in render functions
- **Path Resolution**: Configured Vite to resolve TypeScript path aliases

## Testing Evidence
- All button variants render correctly
- Redux state management works in stories
- No console errors or warnings
- Visual regression tests pass

## Code Quality
- ESLint: Passing (after fixing Storybook import warnings)
- TypeScript: No type errors
- File Structure: FSD-compliant

## Screenshots
- Button component stories working correctly
- All variants (Primary, Secondary, Ghost, Loading, Disabled, Sizes, Colors) rendering properly

## Lessons Learned
1. Storybook 8.x requires explicit React imports in story render functions
2. Path aliases need to be configured in both TypeScript and Vite configs
3. Example stories generated by Storybook may have incorrect imports that need fixing
