# Story 3.2: Firebase Firestore Setup

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** Firestore integrated with Redux Toolkit and proper data fetching patterns,
**so that** the application can read and write data with real-time synchronization.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Firestore SDK is configured with existing database structure
2. Redux Toolkit slices are created for each major collection
3. Real-time listeners are implemented with proper cleanup
4. Direct connection to Firestore without offline caching
5. Data fetching uses Next.js patterns (getServerSideProps/getStaticProps where appropriate)
6. Error handling and retry logic is implemented
7. Loading states are managed consistently

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Initialize Firestore SDK** (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Install Firestore SDK packages if not already installed
  - [x] Configure Firestore in `src/shared/config/firebase.ts`
  - [x] Set up Firestore emulator configuration for local development
  - [x] Use default memory-only cache (no persistence)

- [x] **Task 2: Create Data Model Types** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create TypeScript interfaces in `src/entities/*/types/` for each collection
  - [x] Define TPN Simulation types at `src/entities/simulation/types/index.ts`
  - [x] Define Reference types at `src/entities/reference/types/index.ts`
  - [x] Define Ingredient types at `src/entities/ingredient/types/index.ts`
  - [x] Ensure types match existing Firestore schema exactly

- [x] **Task 3: Create Redux Slices for Collections** (AC: 2, 7)
  - [x] Create simulations slice at `src/entities/simulation/model/simulationSlice.ts`
  - [x] Create references slice at `src/entities/reference/model/referenceSlice.ts`
  - [x] Create ingredients slice at `src/entities/ingredient/model/ingredientSlice.ts`
  - [x] Implement loading, error, and data states in each slice
  - [x] Create selectors for accessing collection data

- [x] **Task 4: Implement Firestore Service Layer** (AC: 3, 6)
  - [x] Create base Firestore service at `src/shared/api/firestore/baseService.ts`
  - [x] Implement collection-specific services in each entity's model folder
  - [x] Add real-time listener management with proper cleanup
  - [x] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
  - [x] Create helper functions for common Firestore operations
  - [x] Handle Firestore-specific errors (permissions, offline, etc.)

- [x] **Task 5: Create Data Fetching Hooks** (AC: 3, 5)
  - [x] Create `useFirestoreCollection` hook for real-time collection data
  - [x] Create `useFirestoreDocument` hook for single document subscriptions
  - [x] Implement automatic listener cleanup on unmount
  - [x] Add SSR/SSG data fetching utilities for Next.js pages
  - [x] Create `getServerSideProps` helper for authenticated data
  - [x] Create `getStaticProps` helper for public data

- [x] **Task 6: Implement Collection-Specific Features** (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Set up tpnSimulations with subcollections (sections)
  - [x] Set up references collection with validation status tracking
  - [x] Set up ingredients collection with sharing capabilities
  - [x] Ensure queries work without authentication context

- [x] **Task 7: Write Tests** (AC: All)
  - [x] Unit tests for Redux slices (60% minimum coverage)
  - [x] Integration tests for Firestore services
  - [x] Test real-time listener cleanup to prevent memory leaks
  - [x] Test error handling and retry logic
  - [x] Mock Firestore for consistent test execution

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.1 (Firebase Anonymous Access):
- Firebase is already initialized at `src/shared/config/firebase.ts`
- No authentication required (anonymous access only if needed)
- No user context in queries

### Firestore Collections Structure
From [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#firestore-collections-structure]:

**Main Collections:**
1. `references` - TPN reference documents with sections subcollection
2. `ingredients` - Shared ingredient library
3. `tpnSimulations` - Patient simulations with sections subcollection

**Collection Schemas** (see database-schema.md for full details):
- References: `{ id, name, healthSystem, populationType, validationStatus, sections[] }`
- Ingredients: `{ id, keyname, name, type, isShared, referenceRanges[] }`
- TPN Simulations: `{ id, name, advisorType, patientProfile, sections[], testSummary }`

### TypeScript Types
From [Source: architecture/data-models.md#core-types]:
```typescript
// Key types to implement:
- TestCase, Section, TestResult, SectionTestResult, TestSummary
- TPNAdvisorType: 'NEO' | 'CHILD' | 'ADOLESCENT' | 'ADULT'
- LoadedIngredient, LoadedReference (workspace types)
```

### File Locations

### Firestore Security Rules
From [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#firestore-security-rules]:
- Note: Security rules may need adjustment for anonymous/no-auth access
- Consider making collections publicly readable/writable
- Or use anonymous auth if Security Rules require authentication

### API Patterns
From [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]:
- Use REST-style endpoints for API routes
- No authentication tokens needed
- Consistent error response format
- Loading states must be tracked in Redux

### Redux State Management
From [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- Redux Toolkit 2.8.2 for all global state
- No Context API for global state
- All async operations wrapped in try-catch

### Testing Requirements

#### Testing Standards
From [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Test files co-located as `*.test.ts(x)`
- Vitest 3.2.4 for unit/integration tests
- 60% unit, 20% integration, 20% E2E split
- Minimum 80% coverage for business logic

#### Firestore Testing Patterns
- Mock Firestore SDK for unit tests
- Use Firestore emulator for integration tests
- Test listener cleanup to verify no memory leaks
