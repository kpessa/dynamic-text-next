## Story Numbering Convention
- Stories use Epic.Story format (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 2.1)
- Epic numbers represent major feature areas in logical sequence:
  - **Epic 1**: Infrastructure Setup (Foundation)
  - **Epic 2**: Core UI Components (Building blocks)
  - **Epic 3**: Backend Integration (Data layer)
  - **Epic 4**: TPN Features (Business logic)
  - **Epic 5**: Testing & Quality (Validation)
  - **Epic 6**: Performance & Deployment (Production)
- Each story should be self-contained with clear acceptance criteria
- Dependencies between stories should be clearly documented
- Keep story documents updated as work progresses
