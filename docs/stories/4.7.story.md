## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 4.2 (Dynamic Text Editor):
- Section interface with test cases already defined
- TestCase structure: `{ id, name, variables, expected, matchType }`
- Editor integration points established

From Story 4.3 (Formula Calculations):
- Formula evaluation context available
- Variable dependencies mapped in calculation engine

From Story 4.6 (KPT Namespace):
- Custom KPT functions must be considered in test generation
- Formatting functions affect expected output validation

#### API Integration Pattern [Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
- Environment variables for API keys: `NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_PROVIDER`, `AI_API_KEY`
- Rate limiting: Maximum 3 requests per second
- Timeout: 30 seconds for AI responses
- Error handling: Exponential backoff with max 3 retries

#### Data Models [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
```typescript
// From existing models - DO NOT MODIFY
interface Section {
  id: number;
  type: 'static' | 'dynamic';
  name?: string;
  content: string;
  testCases: TestCase[];
  populationType?: PopulationType;
}

interface TestCase {
  id?: string;
  name: string;
  variables: Record<string, unknown>;
  expected?: string;
  matchType?: 'exact' | 'contains' | 'regex';
}

// New models for AI feature
interface AITestRequest {
  sectionContent: string;
  sectionType: 'static' | 'dynamic';
  existingVariables?: Record<string, any>;
  tpnContext?: {
    advisorType: TPNAdvisorType;
    populationType: PopulationType;
    ingredients?: IngredientData[];
  };
  testCount?: number;
  testTypes?: Array<'exact' | 'contains' | 'regex'>;
}

interface AITestResponse {
  testCases: TestCase[];
  reasoning: string;
  confidence: number;
  suggestions: string[];
  metrics: TestQualityMetrics;
}

interface TestQualityMetrics {
  coverage: number;        // 0-100
  diversity: number;       // 0-100
  edgeCases: number;      // 0-100
  realistic: number;       // 0-100
  overall: number;        // 0-100
}
```

#### Component Standards [Source: architecture/components.md]
- Use Material UI components as base
- Follow Atomic Design within FSD structure
- All components must have TypeScript interfaces
- Required Storybook stories for each component
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Testing Requirements

#### Testing Standards [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Test File Location**: Adjacent to source in `__tests__` folders
- **Framework**: Vitest 3.2.4 with @testing-library/react
- **Coverage Target**: 80% for critical paths
- **Mocking**: Mock all external API calls
- **Test Data**: Use realistic medical values

Key Test Scenarios:
1. Generate tests for complex dynamic sections with nested calculations
2. Handle AI service failures gracefully with fallback
3. Extract variables from obfuscated or minified code
4. Generate edge case test values for boundary conditions
5. Batch process 50+ sections without memory issues
6. Score test quality accurately against known benchmarks
7. Cache hit/miss scenarios with proper invalidation
8. Rate limiting behavior under load

### Security Considerations [Source: architecture/security-architecture.md]
- API keys stored in environment variables, never in code
- Sanitize all AI-generated content before display
- Validate generated test code for injection attacks
- Rate limit per user session (stored in Redux)
- Audit log all AI generation requests

### Performance Requirements [Source: architecture/performance-optimization.md]
- Initial load: < 500ms for UI components
- AI response: < 5s for single test generation
- Batch processing: < 30s for 10 sections
- Cache hit ratio: > 60% for repeated content
- Memory usage: < 100MB for typical session
