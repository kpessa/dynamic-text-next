# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI
All components extend Material UI v7.3.2 base components with CVA (class-variance-authority) for variant management. Components follow the Atomic Design hierarchy (atoms → molecules → organisms) within the FSD architecture. Consistent theming is achieved through MUI's theme provider with TypeScript interfaces ensuring type safety across all components.

## Modified/New Screens and Views
**New Components Added (Phase 1-3):**
- **Atoms**: Input, Select, Checkbox, Radio, Typography, Alert, Badge, Chip, Progress, Skeleton
- **Molecules**: FormField, SearchBar, DatePicker, FileUpload, Pagination  
- **Organisms**: List (recently consolidated), Form, StepperForm, Navigation, Footer

All components are showcased in Storybook at http://localhost:6006 and available for import from `@/shared/ui/` paths with comprehensive test coverage.

## UI Consistency Requirements
1. **Design Token Compliance**: All components must use MUI theme tokens for colors, spacing, typography
2. **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
3. **Responsive Design**: Components must work across breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg, xl)
4. **Dark Mode Support**: Theme switching capability has been implemented for all components
5. **Visual Regression Testing**: Chromatic integration ensures visual consistency across changes
