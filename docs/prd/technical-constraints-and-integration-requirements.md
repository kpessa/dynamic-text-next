# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

## Existing Technology Stack
**Languages**: TypeScript 5.7+, JavaScript (ES2022+)
**Frameworks**: Next.js 15.5.2 (App Router), React 19.1.0, Redux Toolkit 2.8.2 (migrated from Svelte 5)
**Database**: Firebase Firestore (carried over from Svelte app)
**Infrastructure**: Firebase Hosting/Vercel, Firebase Auth, Firebase Storage, Chromatic visual testing
**External Dependencies**: Material UI 7.3.2, React Hook Form 7.62.0, Firebase SDK, date-fns 4.1.0

## Integration Approach
**Database Integration Strategy**: Firebase Firestore with real-time listeners, maintaining existing data structure from Svelte app, React hooks for Firebase subscriptions
**API Integration Strategy**: Firebase Cloud Functions for server-side logic, Firebase Auth for authentication state, Maintaining existing API contracts from Svelte version
**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Gradual migration from Svelte components to React/Next.js, Feature parity with existing Svelte application, Progressive enhancement with Storybook documentation
**Testing Integration Strategy**: Vitest replacing Svelte testing setup, Storybook for component documentation (not available in Svelte), Playwright MCP for end-to-end testing

## Code Organization and Standards
**File Structure Approach**: Migration from Svelte's component structure to FSD architecture, Preserving business logic while refactoring to React patterns, Atomic Design for new UI components
**Naming Conventions**: Aligning with React/Next.js conventions from Svelte patterns, PascalCase components (was kebab-case in Svelte), Maintaining Firebase collection/document naming
**Coding Standards**: React 19 patterns replacing Svelte reactive statements, Redux Toolkit replacing Svelte stores, Material UI replacing previous UI library
**Documentation Standards**: New Storybook documentation (major improvement over Svelte), Preserving existing Firebase schema documentation, Migration notes for each converted feature

## Deployment and Operations
**Build Process Integration**: Next.js build replacing SvelteKit build, Firebase deployment configuration updated for Next.js, Environment variables migrated to Next.js format
**Deployment Strategy**: Parallel deployment during migration phase, Firebase Hosting with Next.js SSR/SSG support, Gradual feature flag rollout for migrated sections
**Monitoring and Logging**: Firebase Analytics continuity, Firebase Performance Monitoring, Console logging for development debugging
**Configuration Management**: Firebase config in environment variables, Existing Firebase project settings preserved, Firebase emulators for local development

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation
**Technical Risks**: Data migration complexity from Svelte stores to Redux, Firebase real-time listeners memory leaks in React, Authentication state management differences between frameworks
**Integration Risks**: Existing Firebase Security Rules compatibility, Cloud Functions may need updates for Next.js SSR, User sessions during migration rollout
**Deployment Risks**: SEO impact from URL structure changes, Performance differences between Svelte and React, Bundle size increase from framework change
**Mitigation Strategies**: Maintain Firebase backend unchanged initially, Incremental migration with feature flags, Comprehensive testing of Firebase integrations, Side-by-side comparison with original Svelte app
