# Intro Project Analysis and Context

## Existing Project Overview

### Analysis Source
- IDE-based fresh analysis
- User-provided information about Svelte to Next.js migration

### Current Project State
This is a migration project from an existing Svelte 5 application (located at ../dynamic-text/) to Next.js 15.5.2 with React 19.1.0. The project maintains Firebase as the backend (Firestore, Authentication, Storage, Cloud Functions) while completely rebuilding the frontend with improved developer experience through Storybook documentation and component testing.

The migration is currently in progress with infrastructure setup largely complete and UI component library development underway.

## Available Documentation Analysis

### Available Documentation
- ✅ Tech Stack Documentation (package.json, CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ Source Tree/Architecture (FSD structure established)
- ✅ Coding Standards (ESLint, TypeScript configs)
- ⚠️ API Documentation (Firebase APIs from original project)
- ⚠️ External API Documentation (Firebase SDK docs)
- ✅ UX/UI Guidelines (Material UI design system)
- ✅ Technical Debt Documentation (migration stories tracking)
- ✅ Migration Stories (docs/stories/ directory)

## Enhancement Scope Definition

### Enhancement Type
- ✅ Technology Stack Upgrade (Svelte 5 to Next.js 15.5.2)
- ✅ Major Feature Modification (Complete frontend rewrite)
- ✅ UI/UX Overhaul (Material UI v7 implementation)
- ✅ Integration with New Systems (Storybook, Chromatic)

### Enhancement Description
Complete migration of the dynamic-text application from Svelte 5 to Next.js 15.5.2 while maintaining all Firebase backend functionality. The migration includes implementing Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture with Atomic Design principles for component organization, adding Storybook for component documentation, and achieving comprehensive test coverage.

### Impact Assessment
- ✅ Major Impact (architectural changes required)
- Complete frontend framework replacement
- New architectural patterns (FSD)
- Enhanced developer experience with Storybook

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Migrate from Svelte 5 to Next.js 15.5.2 with zero data loss
- Maintain feature parity with existing Svelte application
- Improve component documentation through Storybook integration
- Establish robust testing infrastructure with >90% coverage
- Enable visual regression testing through Chromatic
- Implement proper state management with Redux Toolkit
- Achieve better performance and SEO through Next.js SSR/SSG

### Background Context
The original Svelte 5 application encountered compatibility issues with Storybook, limiting the team's ability to document and test components effectively. Next.js was chosen as the migration target due to its excellent React ecosystem support, strong TypeScript integration, and compatibility with modern development tools. The Firebase backend remains unchanged to minimize risk and maintain data integrity during the migration. This migration represents an opportunity to modernize the codebase while implementing industry best practices for architecture (FSD), component design (Atomic Design), and testing (TDD with Vitest/Playwright).
