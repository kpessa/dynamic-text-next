# Epic 3: Backend Integration

**Epic Goal**: Integrate Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Storage) with the Next.js application, establishing the data layer and user management system while maintaining compatibility with existing Firebase data from the Svelte application.

**Integration Requirements**: All Firebase services must connect to the existing production Firebase project without requiring data migration or schema changes.

## Story 3.1: Firebase Authentication Setup

As a user,
I want to sign in to the Next.js application using my existing credentials,
so that I can access my data and personalized features without creating a new account.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Firebase Auth SDK is configured with existing project credentials
2. Authentication providers from Svelte app are supported (Email/Password, Google, etc.)
3. Redux Toolkit slice manages auth state with proper TypeScript types
4. Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login
5. User profile data is accessible throughout the application
6. Session persistence works across browser refreshes
7. Sign out properly cleans up auth state and redirects

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing user accounts can authenticate successfully
- IV2: Firebase Security Rules recognize authenticated users correctly
- IV3: Auth state changes propagate to all connected components

## Story 3.2: Firebase Firestore Setup

As a developer,
I want Firestore integrated with Redux Toolkit and proper data fetching patterns,
so that the application can read and write data with real-time synchronization.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Firestore SDK is configured with existing database structure
2. Redux Toolkit slices are created for each major collection
3. Real-time listeners are implemented with proper cleanup
4. Offline persistence is enabled for PWA functionality
5. Data fetching uses Next.js patterns (getServerSideProps/getStaticProps where appropriate)
6. Error handling and retry logic is implemented
7. Loading states are managed consistently

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All existing Firestore collections are accessible
- IV2: Document reads/writes maintain data integrity
- IV3: No memory leaks from uncleaned listeners

## Story 3.3: Real-time Data Sync

As a user,
I want changes to data to appear immediately across all my devices,
so that I always see the most current information without manual refresh.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Real-time listeners update Redux state immediately on data changes
2. Optimistic updates provide instant UI feedback
3. Conflict resolution handles simultaneous edits gracefully
4. Subscription management prevents duplicate listeners
5. Performance monitoring tracks real-time update latency
6. Batch operations are optimized for multiple updates
7. Connection state is displayed to users

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Updates propagate within 100ms on good connections
- IV2: Offline changes sync when connection restored
- IV3: No data loss during connection interruptions

## Story 3.4: Firebase Storage Integration

As a user,
I want to upload and manage files in my documents,
so that I can include images, PDFs, and other media in my content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Firebase Storage SDK connects to existing storage buckets
2. File upload component with progress tracking
3. Image optimization and thumbnail generation
4. File type and size validation matching Svelte app limits
5. Secure download URLs with proper access control
6. Media gallery for browsing uploaded files
7. Drag-and-drop upload functionality

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing files in Storage remain accessible
- IV2: Upload/download speeds match Svelte implementation
- IV3: Storage Security Rules enforce proper access

## Story 3.5: Firebase Cloud Functions Integration

As a developer,
I want Cloud Functions integrated for server-side operations,
so that complex business logic and secure operations run in a trusted environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Cloud Functions SDK configured for callable functions
2. Existing Cloud Functions from Svelte app remain compatible
3. Error handling for function invocations
4. Loading states during function execution
5. Retry logic for transient failures
6. TypeScript types for function parameters and responses
7. Local emulator support for development

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: All existing Cloud Functions callable from Next.js
- IV2: Function response times remain consistent
- IV3: Error messages properly propagated to UI
