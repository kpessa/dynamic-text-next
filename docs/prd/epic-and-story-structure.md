# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach
**Epic Structure Decision**: Multiple epics following the existing story structure already established in the project

The project has been organized into 7 logical epics that build upon each other:
1. Infrastructure Setup (Foundation) - Largely complete
2. Core UI Components (Building blocks) - In progress
3. Backend Integration (Data layer) - Next priority
4. TPN Features (Business logic) - Stories drafted (4.1-4.7)
5. Data Management & Collaboration - Stories drafted (5.1-5.2)
6. Testing & Quality (Validation) - Planned
7. Performance & Deployment (Production) - Planned

This structure ensures coordinated migration efforts while maintaining clear boundaries between different aspects of the system.
